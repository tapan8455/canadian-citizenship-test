      <h2>Essential Canadian History for the Citizenship Test</h2>
      <p>Canadian history is a rich tapestry of Indigenous cultures, European exploration, Confederation, and modern development. Understanding key historical events is crucial for passing the citizenship test.</p>
      
      <h3>Pre-Confederation Period</h3>
      
      <h4>Indigenous Peoples</h4>
      <p>Before European contact, Canada was home to diverse Indigenous peoples including the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis. These communities had rich cultures, sophisticated societies, and deep connections to the land.</p>
      
      <h4>European Exploration</h4>
      <p>In the 15th and 16th centuries, European explorers like John Cabot and Jacques Cartier began mapping Canada's coastline. The French established New France, while the British focused on the Atlantic colonies.</p>
      
      <h4>Seven Years' War (1756-1763)</h4>
      <p>This global conflict between Britain and France ended with the Treaty of Paris, which gave Britain control of New France. This marked the beginning of British rule in what would become Canada.</p>
      
      <h3>Confederation and Early Canada</h3>
      
      <h4>Confederation (1867)</h4>
      <p>On July 1, 1867, the British North America Act created the Dominion of Canada, uniting Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. This date is celebrated as Canada Day.</p>
      
      <h4>Expansion Westward</h4>
      <p>Canada expanded westward through the purchase of Rupert's Land and the creation of new provinces and territories. The construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway (completed in 1885) was crucial for national unity.</p>
      
      <h4>First Prime Ministers</h4>
      <p>Sir John A. Macdonald, Canada's first Prime Minister, led the country through its early years. Other important early leaders included Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who promoted immigration and economic growth.</p>
      
      <h3>20th Century Developments</h3>
      
      <h4>World Wars</h4>
      <p>Canada participated in both World Wars as part of the British Empire and later as an independent nation. The country's contributions helped establish its international reputation and independence.</p>
      
      <h4>Women's Suffrage</h4>
      <p>Women gained the right to vote in federal elections in 1918, though some provinces had granted this right earlier. This was a significant step toward gender equality in Canada.</p>
      
      <h4>Great Depression</h4>
      <p>The 1930s brought economic hardship to Canada, leading to social and political changes. The government began to play a larger role in providing social services.</p>
      
      <h3>Modern Canada</h3>
      
      <h4>Post-War Growth</h4>
      <p>After World War II, Canada experienced significant economic growth and social change. The country became more urbanized and industrialized.</p>
      
      <h4>Constitutional Changes</h4>
      <p>In 1982, Canada patriated its constitution with the Canada Act, which included the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This gave Canada full control over its constitution.</p>
      
      <h4>Multiculturalism</h4>
      <p>Canada officially adopted multiculturalism as a policy in 1971, recognizing the value of cultural diversity and promoting equality for all Canadians.</p>
